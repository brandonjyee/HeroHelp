# HeroHelp
![HeroHelp](https://ibb.co/kA0CYU)

Two-sided real-time coordinated mobile app system for incident management. Citizens can call for help and Heroes can respond to dispatches and resolve incidents. It's the modern-day Bat-Signal.

What happens when four students at Fullstack Academy in Chicago have two weeks to put together a Capstone project, a demonstration-grade product showcasing many of the web technologies they just learned for the first time during the prior 10 weeks, along with their brand new JavaScript and development skills?

## Built With

* [React Native](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) - mobile application front end framework
* [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) - React Native UI framework
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - front end state management
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/) - send messages between citizen, hero, and server
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) - front end map interface
* [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) - complimentary library to React Native
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) - database queries
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) - object-relational database management system

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

This repo contains multiple projects (i.e. admin, client, server, simulator, etc) that have their own package dependencies. You must go into each of these top-level directories and run 

```
npm install
```
An explanation of the top-level projects:
* **admin** : contains the admin interface
* **client** : contains the Citizen & Hero React Native apps
* **server** : contains the backend-server
* **simulator**    : contains the simulator. Essentially a node client that simulates the Citizen and Hero clients for helping to test the React Native apps independently


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
